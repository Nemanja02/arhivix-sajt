    title: "Frequently asked questions",

    q1: "Where are my documents stored?",
    a1: "Your documents are stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. Specifically, we use two separate S3 storage locations in two different European regions. This means that even in the event of technical issues in one region, your documents remain safe and accessible in the other. Everything is automatically encrypted.",
    q2: "Can someone access my files without my knowledge?",
    a2: "No. All files are encrypted and cannot be opened without a unique key tied to your account. Even our team cannot access your documents. For each user in your company, you can set individual permissions: who can view, edit, or download each document.",
    q3: "What is artificial intelligence in Arhivix?",
    a3: "Arhivix automatically indexes every document you upload. Our AI system reads and understands the content of your documents, so you can search using natural language. For example, you can type \"Find my phone bill from April\" and the system will locate the exact document. No manual searching, no wasted time.",
    q4: "Is the system compliant with the new electronic shipping documents law?",
    a4: "Yes, fully. Starting January 1, 2026, electronic shipping documents are a legal requirement. Arhivix supports creating, sending, receiving, and archiving electronic shipping documents and receipts in compliance with all regulations.",
    q5: "What if I am not a technical person? Is it complicated to use?",
    a5: "Not at all. Arhivix is designed to be simple for everyone. A document is archived in three steps, search works like a conversation with an assistant, and the entire system is intuitive. If you ever need help, we are here 24/7."
