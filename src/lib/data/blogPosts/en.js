      <h2>Introduction: Electronic Invoicing in Serbia</h2>
      <p>In 2022, Serbia launched the Electronic Invoice System (SEF) as a centralized state platform for issuing, sending, receiving, and storing electronic invoices. Since January 2023, using the SEF has been mandatory for all VAT payers in the private sector.</p>
      <p>The goal of the system is the complete digitalization of invoicing, reduction of tax fraud, and automation of business processes. Instead of paper invoices, PDFs, or emails, all invoices pass through a unified state system in a structured XML format.</p>

      <h2>What Is SEF (Electronic Invoice System)?</h2>
      <p>SEF is the central platform of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Serbia for electronic invoicing. It was developed as a mandatory system through which all invoices between business entities must pass.</p>
      <p>Key features of the SEF system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structured XML format</strong> enabling automatic processing</li>
        <li><strong>Unique identification number</strong> for each invoice</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic verification</strong> of data accuracy</li>
        <li><strong>Invoice storage for a minimum of 10 years</strong> (5 years for non-VAT payers)</li>
        <li><strong>Electronic signature or certificate</strong> for registration and access</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Must Use SEF?</h2>
      <p>The obligation to use the SEF system depends on the type of entity:</p>

      <h3>Mandatory since January 2023:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>All VAT payers</strong> in the private sector (B2B transactions)</li>
        <li><strong>Public sector entities</strong> (state institutions, public enterprises)</li>
        <li><strong>Private sector to public sector</strong> (B2G transactions)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Also mandatory for:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-VAT payers who invoice the public sector</li>
        <li>All entities that receive invoices from VAT payers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The only exception is individuals who do not conduct business activities and small entrepreneurs who are not in the VAT system and do not do business with the public sector.</p>

      <h2>How Does SEF Work in Practice?</h2>
      <p>The electronic invoicing process through SEF works as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Creating the invoice</strong> in your accounting software or directly on the SEF portal</li>
        <li><strong>Sending through SEF</strong> in the prescribed XML format</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic verification</strong> of data by the system (tax ID, amount, VAT)</li>
        <li><strong>Assignment of a unique number</strong> and issue date</li>
        <li><strong>Receipt by the buyer</strong> through the SEF system</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptance or rejection</strong> of the invoice by the recipient</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent storage</strong> in the system (minimum 10 years)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Deadlines for Receiving and Accepting Invoices</h2>

            <td>12 days from end of tax period</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>What Changes from 2026?</h2>
      <p>The Law on Electronic Invoicing was amended at the end of 2025, and the most important changes take effect during 2026:</p>

      <h3>From March 2026:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandatory internal invoices</strong> generated directly in SEF (for existing system users)</li>
        <li><strong>Electronic invoicing for retail</strong> in certain cases</li>
        <li><strong>B2G electronic delivery notes</strong> become mandatory for the private sector</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>From late 2026 / early 2027:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-filled VAT returns</strong> based on data from SEF</li>
        <li>Automatic reconciliation of incoming and outgoing invoices</li>
        <li>Greater automation of tax obligations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of Electronic Invoicing</h2>
      <p>Switching to electronic invoices brings concrete benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Savings of up to 80% in costs</strong> compared to paper invoicing</li>
        <li><strong>Elimination of errors</strong> from manual data entry</li>
        <li><strong>Faster payment process</strong> as the invoice arrives instantly</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic storage</strong> without physical archive space</li>
        <li><strong>Easier oversight</strong> and review of all issued and received invoices</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> without additional administrative work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2>
      <p>Failure to meet electronic invoicing obligations carries penalties:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Penalties for legal entities: <strong>200,000 to 2,000,000 RSD</strong><br>For entrepreneurs: <strong>50,000 to 500,000 RSD</strong><br>For responsible persons: <strong>50,000 to 150,000 RSD</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Penalties apply for: not issuing an e-invoice within the prescribed deadline, failure to register in the SEF system, not accepting an invoice within the legal deadline, and non-compliance with the XML format.</p>

      <h2>Introduction: Why Are Electronic Delivery Notes Being Introduced?</h2>
      <p>Starting in 2026, Serbia begins the gradual implementation of the Law on Electronic Delivery Notes. The goal is to record the movement of goods digitally, faster and more precisely, with full automation of transport tracking. Instead of paper, stamps, and manual filling, every shipment of goods will be accompanied by an electronic document that passes through a central state system.</p>
      <p>This is one of the largest digitalizations in business in our country and directly affects almost all companies that send, receive, or transport goods.</p>

      <h2>What Is an Electronic Delivery Note?</h2>
      <p>An electronic delivery note is a digital document that accompanies goods during transport. It must be created, sent, and received through the official state system, in a structured format that enables automatic processing.</p>
      <p>It contains key data, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is sending the goods</li>
        <li>Who is receiving the goods</li>
        <li>What is being sent and in what quantity</li>
        <li>Time and place of departure</li>
        <li>Time and place of delivery</li>
        <li>Who is the carrier</li>
        <li>QR code for verification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal of the system is to provide transparent and always available tracking of goods movement, without manipulation or errors.</p>

      <h2>Who Is Required to Send Electronic Delivery Notes?</h2>
      <p>The obligation applies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Private sector entities</strong> (VAT payers and companies participating in the dispatch of goods)</li>
        <li><strong>Public sector entities</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Transport operators</strong> (when maintaining records on behalf of clients)</li>
        <li><strong>Carriers</strong> (for collecting and presenting delivery notes during inspections)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Individuals who do not conduct business activities are not covered by the law.</p>

      <h2>When Do the Obligations Take Effect?</h2>
      <p>According to the law and its amendments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the public sector -- from <strong>January 1, 2026</strong></li>
        <li>For the private sector regarding excise products -- from <strong>January 1, 2026</strong></li>
        <li>For the private sector in all goods trade -- from <strong>October 1, 2027</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Therefore, all companies in Serbia will have to switch to the electronic delivery note system by October 2027 at the latest.</p>

      <h2>When Is an Electronic Delivery Note Not Required?</h2>
      <p>The law provides several exceptions. A delivery note is not required in situations such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delivery of water, electricity, gas, and similar goods through networks</li>
        <li>Retail trade (a fiscal receipt is sufficient)</li>
        <li>Deliveries within the same public entity</li>
        <li>Returning goods using the same transport vehicle</li>
        <li>Deliveries within approved clinical trials</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This significantly simplifies operations for retail stores and parts of the public system.</p>

      <h2>What Does the Process Look Like in Practice?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The sender</strong> creates an electronic delivery note in the system.</li>
        <li><strong>The carrier</strong> picks up the delivery note through the system or receives a printed QR display if they are not a system user.</li>
        <li><strong>The recipient</strong> confirms physical receipt of goods within 3 business days of delivery.</li>
        <li>Then accepts or rejects the delivery note within 8 days.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If the recipient does not send a receipt confirmation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the public sector -- the goods are considered <strong>accepted</strong></li>
        <li>For the private sector -- the goods are considered <strong>rejected</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ensures that the movement of goods is recorded without delays and that each party has clear responsibility.</p>

      <h2>What If the System Is Down or There Is No Internet?</h2>
      <p>The law provides for this possibility as well: a company can temporarily use a paper delivery note with a holographic sticker issued by the National Banknote Printing Institute.</p>
      <p>When internet or the system is restored, the company is required to enter all data into the system by the next business day at the latest.</p>

      <h2>What Does This Mean for Businesses in Practice?</h2>

      <h3>1. Less Paper, More Digital Business</h3>
      <p>Paper delivery notes are being replaced by an automated system. Companies need technical adaptation: software, employee training, reliable internet connection.</p>

      <h3>2. Stronger Control and Transparency</h3>
      <p>The system allows the state to track the movement of goods in real time. This reduces opportunities for abuse but increases the responsibility of companies.</p>

      <h3>3. Penalties for Non-Compliance</h3>
      <p>Penalties are provided for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sending a delivery note outside the prescribed deadline</li>
        <li>Failure to confirm receipt</li>
        <li>Misuse of data</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Penalties for legal entities: <strong>200,000 to 2,000,000 RSD</strong><br>For entrepreneurs: <strong>50,000 to 500,000 RSD</strong></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>4. Adjustment Period</h3>
      <p>From January 1 to June 30, 2026, errors in filling out data will not be penalized -- this is a period for learning and process optimization.</p>

      <h3>5. Simpler Oversight and Proof of Delivery</h3>
      <p>Everything is digitally archived, easily accessible, without losing papers and without disputes about whether goods were actually delivered.</p>

      <h2>What Does This Mean for Citizens?</h2>
      <p>Although the law primarily affects businesses, citizens gain several indirect benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Safer and more transparent deliveries</li>
        <li>Less room for the gray economy</li>
        <li>Faster and more reliable procurement and delivery processes</li>
        <li>Better consumer protection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Citizens who are not entrepreneurs have no new obligations.</p>

      <h2>Types of Documentation in the Archive Book</h2>
      <p>The archive book is a collection of all business documents that must be systematically recorded and preserved. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial documents:</strong> Invoices, bank statements, contracts with suppliers and customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Employment documents:</strong> Employment contracts, registrations and deregistrations of obligations, work tenure reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Property documentation:</strong> Sale, purchase, and lease contracts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Retention Period for Documentation</h2>
      <p>Documents entered into the archive book must be recorded for the appropriate period, in accordance with legal norms:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Documentation Type</th>
            <th>Retention Period</th>

      <h2>Why Is Proper Documentation Entry Important?</h2>
      <p>Properly entering documentation into the archive book enables:</p>

        <li>Easier access to information and efficient organization.</li>
        <li>Compliance with legal requirements.</li>
        <li>Simpler resolution of potential issues with competent archives.</li>

      <p>Electronic document archiving is becoming increasingly important for business, especially due to new legal obligations such as the submission of the archive book in 2025. As electronic archiving becomes mandatory, it is essential to understand the difference between electronic and digitized documents.</p>

      <h2>What Is an Electronic Document?</h2>
      <p>An electronic document is a record created directly in digital format and can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An electronic invoice</li>
        <li>A digitally signed contract</li>
        <li>A document generated in electronic archiving software</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification, and Trust Services in Electronic Business, an electronic document is defined as <em>"a set of data composed of letters, numbers, symbols, graphic, audio, and video materials, in electronic form"</em>.</p>

      <h3>Advantages of Electronic Document Archiving:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced paper and printing costs</li>
        <li>Fast search and sharing</li>
        <li>Greater legal security with digital signatures and encryption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Is a Digitized Document?</h2>
      <p>A digitized document is a paper document converted into digital format. These are, for example, scanned invoices or digital copies of contracts.</p>

      <h3>The Importance of Digitization for Mandatory Document Archiving:</h3>
      <p>Digitization enables better organization of archive materials and facilitates the fulfillment of legal obligations, such as the submission of the archive book.</p>

      <h2>Key Differences Between Electronic and Digitized Documents</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Characteristic</th>
            <th>Electronic Document</th>
            <th>Digitized Document</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Origin</td>
            <td>Created digitally</td>
            <td>Converted from paper</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Use</td>
            <td>Ideal for new business processes</td>
            <td>Archiving older records</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Legal validity</td>
            <td>Greater legal force with digital signature</td>
            <td>Depends on the digitization procedure</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>How to Choose the Right Strategy for Electronic Archiving?</h2>
      <p>Your strategy should combine both approaches. Electronic archiving is ideal for new documents, while digitization helps organize existing archives and facilitates the submission of the archive book in 2025.</p>

      <p>Understanding the differences between electronic and digitized documents is key to successful archive management. Although it may seem complex, with <strong>Arhivix</strong>, you can easily implement electronic archiving solutions and align your business with legal requirements.</p>

      <p>With the introduction of new legal regulations, companies are required to adapt and comply with the rules related to electronic archiving and document management. One of the main questions companies ask is: is it necessary to create a new office management regulation to comply with the new Document Archiving Law?</p>

      <h2>What Changes with the New Law?</h2>
      <p>The new mandatory document archiving law requires companies to provide a legal basis for the storage, protection, and use of archive materials. This implies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aligning business procedures with new legal norms.</li>
        <li>Implementing standards for electronic archiving and data protection.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is a New Regulation Mandatory?</h2>
      <p>If your company already has an office management regulation, it may not be necessary to adopt an entirely new one. However, it may be necessary to adapt the existing regulation to comply with the new legislation, especially regarding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Electronic document archiving.</li>
        <li>Data security and protection.</li>
        <li>Obligations for submitting the archive book in 2025.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of New Regulations</h2>
      <p>Creating a new or adapting an existing regulation enables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Guiding employees in proper document management.</li>
        <li>A clear division of responsibilities regarding archive materials.</li>
        <li>Compliance with legal regulations, thereby avoiding potential legal consequences.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Adapting or creating a new office management regulation is key to efficient business document management. By using electronic archiving tools such as <strong>Arhivix</strong>, you can ensure your business is compliant with legal norms and the archive book submission deadline of 2025.</p>

      <p>Electronic document archiving is becoming increasingly important for business, especially due to new legal obligations such as the submission of the archive book in 2025. As electronic archiving becomes mandatory, it is essential to understand the difference between electronic and digitized documents.</p>

      <h2>What Is an Electronic Document?</h2>
      <p>An electronic document is a record created directly in digital format and can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An electronic invoice</li>
        <li>A digitally signed contract</li>
        <li>A document generated in electronic archiving software</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification, and Trust Services in Electronic Business, an electronic document is defined as <em>"a set of data composed of letters, numbers, symbols, graphic, audio, and video materials, in electronic form"</em>.</p>

      <h3>Advantages of Electronic Document Archiving:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced paper and printing costs</li>
        <li>Fast search and sharing</li>
        <li>Greater legal security with digital signatures and encryption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Is a Digitized Document?</h2>
      <p>A digitized document is a paper document converted into digital format. These are, for example, scanned invoices or digital copies of contracts.</p>

      <h3>The Importance of Digitization for Mandatory Document Archiving:</h3>
      <p>Digitization enables better organization of archive materials and facilitates the fulfillment of legal obligations, such as the submission of the archive book.</p>

      <h2>Key Differences Between Electronic and Digitized Documents</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Characteristic</th>
            <th>Electronic Document</th>
            <th>Digitized Document</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Origin</td>
            <td>Created digitally</td>
            <td>Converted from paper</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Use</td>
            <td>Ideal for new business processes</td>
            <td>Archiving older records</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Legal validity</td>
            <td>Greater legal force with digital signature</td>
            <td>Depends on the digitization procedure</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>How to Choose the Right Strategy for Electronic Archiving?</h2>
      <p>Your strategy should combine both approaches. Electronic archiving is ideal for new documents, while digitization helps organize existing archives and facilitates the submission of the archive book in 2025.</p>

      <p>Understanding the differences between electronic and digitized documents is key to successful archive management. Although it may seem complex, with <strong>Arhivix</strong>, you can easily implement electronic archiving solutions and align your business with legal requirements.</p>

      <h2>Introduction: Why Are Electronic Delivery Notes Being Introduced?</h2>
      <p>Starting in 2026, Serbia begins the gradual implementation of the Law on Electronic Delivery Notes. The goal is to record the movement of goods digitally, faster and more precisely, with full automation of transport tracking. Instead of paper, stamps, and manual filling, every shipment of goods will be accompanied by an electronic document that passes through a central state system.</p>
      <p>This is one of the largest digitalizations in business in our country and directly affects almost all companies that send, receive, or transport goods.</p>

      <h2>What Is an Electronic Delivery Note?</h2>
      <p>An electronic delivery note is a digital document that accompanies goods during transport. It must be created, sent, and received through the official state system, in a structured format that enables automatic processing.</p>
      <p>It contains key data, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is sending the goods</li>
        <li>Who is receiving the goods</li>
        <li>What is being sent and in what quantity</li>
        <li>Time and place of departure</li>
        <li>Time and place of delivery</li>
        <li>Who is the carrier</li>
        <li>QR code for verification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal of the system is to provide transparent and always available tracking of goods movement, without manipulation or errors.</p>

      <h2>Who Is Required to Send Electronic Delivery Notes?</h2>
      <p>The obligation applies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Private sector entities</strong> (VAT payers and companies participating in the dispatch of goods)</li>
        <li><strong>Public sector entities</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Transport operators</strong> (when maintaining records on behalf of clients)</li>
        <li><strong>Carriers</strong> (for collecting and presenting delivery notes during inspections)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Individuals who do not conduct business activities are not covered by the law.</p>

      <h2>When Do the Obligations Take Effect?</h2>
      <p>According to the law and its amendments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the public sector -- from <strong>January 1, 2026</strong></li>
        <li>For the private sector regarding excise products -- from <strong>January 1, 2026</strong></li>
        <li>For the private sector in all goods trade -- from <strong>October 1, 2027</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Therefore, all companies in Serbia will have to switch to the electronic delivery note system by October 2027 at the latest.</p>

      <h2>When Is an Electronic Delivery Note Not Required?</h2>
      <p>The law provides several exceptions. A delivery note is not required in situations such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delivery of water, electricity, gas, and similar goods through networks</li>
        <li>Retail trade (a fiscal receipt is sufficient)</li>
        <li>Deliveries within the same public entity</li>
        <li>Returning goods using the same transport vehicle</li>
        <li>Deliveries within approved clinical trials</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This significantly simplifies operations for retail stores and parts of the public system.</p>

      <h2>What Does the Process Look Like in Practice?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The sender</strong> creates an electronic delivery note in the system.</li>
        <li><strong>The carrier</strong> picks up the delivery note through the system or receives a printed QR display if they are not a system user.</li>
        <li><strong>The recipient</strong> confirms physical receipt of goods within 3 business days of delivery.</li>
        <li>Then accepts or rejects the delivery note within 8 days.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If the recipient does not send a receipt confirmation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the public sector -- the goods are considered <strong>accepted</strong></li>
        <li>For the private sector -- the goods are considered <strong>rejected</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ensures that the movement of goods is recorded without delays and that each party has clear responsibility.</p>

      <h2>What If the System Is Down or There Is No Internet?</h2>
      <p>The law provides for this possibility as well: a company can temporarily use a paper delivery note with a holographic sticker issued by the National Banknote Printing Institute.</p>
      <p>When internet or the system is restored, the company is required to enter all data into the system by the next business day at the latest.</p>

      <h2>What Does This Mean for Businesses in Practice?</h2>

      <h3>1. Less Paper, More Digital Business</h3>
      <p>Paper delivery notes are being replaced by an automated system. Companies need technical adaptation: software, employee training, reliable internet connection.</p>

      <h3>2. Stronger Control and Transparency</h3>
      <p>The system allows the state to track the movement of goods in real time. This reduces opportunities for abuse but increases the responsibility of companies.</p>

      <h3>3. Penalties for Non-Compliance</h3>
      <p>Penalties are provided for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sending a delivery note outside the prescribed deadline</li>
        <li>Failure to confirm receipt</li>
        <li>Misuse of data</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Penalties for legal entities: <strong>200,000 to 2,000,000 RSD</strong><br>For entrepreneurs: <strong>50,000 to 500,000 RSD</strong></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>4. Adjustment Period</h3>
      <p>From January 1 to June 30, 2026, errors in filling out data will not be penalized -- this is a period for learning and process optimization.</p>

      <h3>5. Simpler Oversight and Proof of Delivery</h3>
      <p>Everything is digitally archived, easily accessible, without losing papers and without disputes about whether goods were actually delivered.</p>

      <h2>What Does This Mean for Citizens?</h2>
      <p>Although the law primarily affects businesses, citizens gain several indirect benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Safer and more transparent deliveries</li>
        <li>Less room for the gray economy</li>
        <li>Faster and more reliable procurement and delivery processes</li>
        <li>Better consumer protection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Citizens who are not entrepreneurs have no new obligations.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Electronic delivery notes represent a major step in the digitalization of business in Serbia. Although the transition will require time and technical preparation, in the long run they bring less bureaucracy, fewer errors, and faster processes.</p>
      <p><strong>This is not just an administrative change -- it is a transition to a more modern, more organized, and more secure system that benefits both businesses and consumers.</strong></p>
